Build your first model
======================

In order to build a model for the first time you'll need access to its repositories,
so that the source code can be downloaded. Depending on which model you are aiming for,
you'll need access to gitlab.dkrz.de and/or gitlab.awi.de. Please, contact the workshop
organizers if you don't have access for the model repositories.

Here we will be building either `AWI-CM3-v3.1` or `AWI-ESM-2.1` in `Ollie` (additionally you can
choose to also build them for `Levante`):

1. Log-in into the HPC of your choice.
2. Make a folder to store the codes and navigate to it, for example, in `Ollie`:
    ```
    cd $WORK
    mkdir model_codes
    cd model_codes
    ```
3. Download and build the model of your choice, by running:

    - **AWI-CM3-v3.1**
      ```
      esm_master install-awicm3-v3.1
      ```
    - **AWI-ESM-2.1**
      ```
      esm_master install-awiesm-2.1
      ```
4. At this point `git` will ask you to enter your user name and password for the different repositories.
    If you have any problems with this step, chances are that you don't have rights to the repos, so
    please contact the workshop organizers.
5. If building is successful, you should see the following binaries in the `<model>/bin` folder:

    - **AWI-CM3-v3.1**
      ```
      ls awicm3-v3.1/bin
      ```
      `fesom.x`, `oifs`, `rnfma`, `xios.x`
    
    - **AWI-ESM-2.1**
      ```
      ls awiesm-2.1/bin
      ```
      `echam6`, `fesom.x`
