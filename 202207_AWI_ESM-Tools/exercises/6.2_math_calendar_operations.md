Math and calendar operations
============================

Runscript: `workshops/runscripts/fesom_runscript.yaml`

Call a calendar variable and operate with it
--------------------------------------------

The feature time variable `end_date` takes values of a calendar object inside of ESM-Runscripts at runtime.
The date expressed by this object is that of one of the end of the current run. In your FESOM runscript, in the
`general` section:

1. Use create a new variable `my_date` that is the result of adding 1 year to the `end_date` variable.
2. Define a `my_year` variable with the value being the result of extracting the year from `my_date`.
3. Define a `my_string` variable where you concatenate the `my_string` value to another string (i.e. `a_file_name_`).
3. Run `esm_runscripts` in check mode, open the finished_config file (`<experiment_dir>/run_DATE/config/*finished_config.yaml`) and check that your all the variables you defined contian the expected values.
