Install ESM-Tools
=================

If you don't have `ESM-Tools` installed in `Ollie` or in `Levante` please follow these steps:

1. Log-in into the HPC of your choice.
2. Open your profile file (i.e. `$HOME/.bash_profile`) and add the following lines to it:
    ```
    module load git
    module load python3
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
    export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
    ```
3. Source that file, so that the edits you just made are available to the machine environment (i.e. `source $HOME/.bash_profile`)
4. Navigate to the folder where you would like to install ESM-Tools into (any path would work, e.g. `mkdir $HOME/utilities; cd $HOME/utilities`)
5. Clone ESM-Tools repo:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/esm-tools/esm_tools.git
     ```
6. This would create the `esm_tools` folder inside your current path. Navigate into it (`cd esm_tools`) and run: 
     ```
     ./install.sh
     ```
